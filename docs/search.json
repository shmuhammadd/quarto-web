    "text": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an acute injury that is understudied in civilian cohorts, especially among women, as TBI has historically been considered to be largely a condition of athletes and military service people. Both the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Defense (DOD)/Veterans Affairs (VA) have developed case definitions to identify patients with TBI from medical records; however, their definitions differ. We sought to re-examine these definitions to construct an expansive and more inclusive definition among a cohort of women with TBI.\nMethods: In this study, we use electronic health records (EHR) from a single healthcare system to study the impact of using different case definitions to identify patients with TBI. Specifically, we identified adult female patients with TBI using the CDC definition, DOD/VA definition and a combined and expanded definition herein called the Penn definition.\nResults: We identified 4446 adult-female TBI patients meeting the CDC definition, 3619 meeting the DOD/VA definition, and together, 6432 meeting our expanded Penn definition that includes the CDC ad DOD/VA definitions.\nConclusions: Using the expanded definition identified almost two times as many patients, enabling investigations to more fully characterise these patients and related outcomes. Our expanded TBI case definition is available to other researchers interested in employing EHRs to investigate TBI."

This retrospective study explores the potential of using electronic health record (EHR) data to inform safety profiles of repurposed COVID medication therapies on pregnancy outcomes using pre-COVID data. We conducted a medication-wide association study (MWAS) on prescription medication exposures during pregnancy and the risk of cesarean section, preterm birth, and stillbirth, using EHR data between 2010–2017 on deliveries at PennMedicine. Repurposed drugs studied for treatment of COVID-19 were extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 138). We adjusted for known comorbidities diagnosed within 2 years prior to birth. Using previously developed medication mapping and delivery-identification algorithms, we identified medication exposure in 2,830 of a total 63,334 deliveries; from 138 trials, we found 31 medications prescribed and included in our cohort. We found 21 (68%) of the 31 medications were not positively associated with increased risk of the outcomes examined. With caution, these medications warrant potential for inclusion of pregnant individuals in future studies, while drugs found to be associated with pregnancy outcomes require further investigation. MWAS facilitates hypothesis-driven evaluation of drug safety across all prescription medications, revealing potential drug candidates for further research."
