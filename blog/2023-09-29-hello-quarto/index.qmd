## Goodbye, Hugo ApÃ©ro

In 2019 I created my first website using blogdown and the [Hugo Academic theme](https://hugo-academic--silvia.netlify.app/), and in 2021 I migrated that site to the [Hugo ApÃ©ro theme](https://hugo-apero--silvia.netlify.app/) created by Alison Hill. I even [documented that trek in great detail ðŸ˜…](../2021-06-01-hello-hugo-apero/) to provide something resembling a paved path for others to use on their journey adopting this beautiful and functional theme. Over the past two years, my ApÃ©ro site became a wonderful place to cultivate a [digital garden](https://youtu.be/E5ERSfydB30?feature=shared&t=694)^[See also [Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/)]. Now the time has come to say thank you, say goodbye, and travel down a new path. Enter Quarto.
